# 4990_project

This is the repository for 4990 Final Project

Introduction:
---

In this project, we will build a machine learning model which will accurately predict the travel time of a taxi trip in New York City. The datasets are extracted from the bigquery. After constructing features from the dataset, we try to build different machine learning models, including linear regression model (OLS, Lasso, Ridge), random forest, adaboost. We compare the performance of each model and choose the best one as our final model.
